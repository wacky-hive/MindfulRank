Reviews of Carac
by
Louise A.
from Eugene, OR, USA
That it is a local company, the staff (George) was extremely helpful, the car was economical to use, and most of all that we were fully covered with no deductible and no extra charges. Just easy and simple. Thank you very much!

Torunn H.
from Norway
I never use the website, that's why I haven't answered these questions. I always send a mail to Petros and I am very pleased every time. As always your representative that met me at the airport was very nice and polite. Wish you all the best. Best regards, Torunn

from United Kingdom
Great service with friendly and helpful staff.  Unlike the huge queue for Hertz, we were served instantly and within minutes were being shown to our car.  Our son's car seat had already been fitted and a member of staff loaded our luggage into the vehicle while we signed the paperwork.  Another member of staff gave us a thorough walkthrough of the vehicle and its controls (headlights, wind screen wipers etc).  In the past we've gone with big car rental companies but have always found them to be expensive and the service poor.  Carac has been without a doubt the best car rental experience we've had and we will definitely use them again.

We took a car for a short term. Mr George Maniatis delivered a car directly to the airport arrival entrance. Great approach , easy and quick communication. He is professional and polite. The car itself was clean, no bad smell inside. It was our first time to use this company and we are extremely satisfied. Perfect value for money! Without any hesitation, will recommend it to my friends and other people.

Jack Williams
Pickup was the easiest thing I have ever done. Communication via whatsapp so it was super easy.  Car was lovely, reasonable price too! Given with a full tank of fuel all we had to do was replace what we had used. The staff are super friendly, genuinely couldn’t do enough for us. We had a mix-matched experience via LoveHolidays and this car hire made things much easier for us. Drop off was easy too, even though the chaotic Heraklion Airport tried to make it difficult. We could not recommend this car hire company enough. We will definitely be using them when we come back next year! Thank you guys!

Rental Terms
Welcome to
Carac Rent a Car
. We aim to provide you with a seamless, safe, and informed rental experience. By renting a vehicle from us, you agree to the following Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully to understand our policies on driver requirements, security deposits, insurance coverage, vehicle use, fees, and other important aspects of your rental.
Booking
Availability:
We confirm bookings by car category, not by specific car model. You may request a specific model and we will note your preference, but it cannot be guaranteed. If the exact model you booked is unavailable, we will provide a similar or upgraded vehicle from the same category at no extra charge. We ensure that the substitute vehicle will have equal or greater seating capacity and luggage space, and similar transmission type as booked.
Minimum Rental Period:
The minimum chargeable rental period is  24 hours. We generally do not provide rentals for shorter periods. If you need a vehicle for only a few hours, you will still be charged the 1-day rate. Additionally, very last-minute rentals may not be possible; we recommend booking at least a day in advance. For any special short-term needs, please call us to check availability.
Delayed Flights/Arrivals:
If your flight is delayed or you are running late to the pick-up, please inform us as soon as possible. We will adjust our meet-and-greet times to accommodate delays when notified. Your reservation will be honored beyond the scheduled time, especially if we have your updated arrival details.
Emergency Contact:
In case of any emergency, you can reach our 24/7 support at +30 6955588771. We include this number on your rental agreement and key fob. We are here to help you at any time.
Privacy:
Your personal information is collected for the rental agreement and insurance requirements. We handle all personal data according to our Privacy Policy and Greek data protection laws. We will not use your information for unsolicited marketing unless you opt in.
Acceptance of Terms:
By taking possession of the rental vehicle, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to all terms and conditions stated in this document and in the rental agreement. Any violations of these terms may result in additional charges and/or termination of the rental.
Should you have any questions or need clarification on these Terms and Conditions, feel free to contact us or refer to our FAQ page. We are committed to transparency and customer satisfaction. Thank you for choosing Carac Rent a Car – we wish you a safe and enjoyable journey with your rental vehicle!
Driver Eligibility and Requirements
Age Requirements:
The main driver (and any additional drivers) must be at least 21 years old for most car categories. A higher minimum age of 23 years applies for Large, Crossover, SUV, People Carrier and Premium categories. The maximum rental age is 70 years. Drivers aged 19–20 or 71–75 may still be eligible to rent a vehicle by adding an Extended Age Coverage, subject to an additional fee of €10 per rental day. Important Note: Age is verified at pick-up. If you do not meet the age requirements, the rental will be refused and the full rental fee may be charged as a cancellation fee.
Driver’s License:
A valid driving license held for at least 1 year is required from the main driver (and any additional drivers). We accept licenses from the EU, UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Israel, Russia, and Ukraine. Note that an International Driving Permit (IDP) is required if your license was issued in any country not listed. All licenses must be valid (not expired or suspended) at the time of rental.
Identification:
The main driver and all additional drivers must present a valid passport or national ID card at pick-up, in addition to their driver’s license.
Additional Drivers:
Additional drivers are permitted but must meet the same age and license requirements as the primary driver. All additional drivers must be present at pick-up to be added to the rental agreement. There is no charge for the first additional driver. A fee of €3 per day applies for a second additional driver. A maximum of 3 drivers including the main driver can be registered per rental contract. Unlisted/unapproved drivers are not allowed to drive the vehicle (any damage or incident caused by an undeclared driver is not covered by insurance).
Renter Responsibilities
Fuel Policy:
We offer a fuel Same-to-Same policy (Return with Same Fuel Level). The car will be provided with a certain fuel level (always at least ¼ tank). You must return the vehicle with the same level of fuel as you received. For example, if you receive the car full, return it full. if you received ½ tank, return ½ tank. If the car is returned with less fuel than given, you will be charged for the missing fuel at the prevailing rate per liter, plus a €12 refueling service fee. Our team will document the fuel level at pick-up and note it in your contract. No refunds are given for extra fuel in the tank upon return, it will be consider a kind gesture to the next renter.
Mileage:
For rentals lasting from
1
to
2 days, price includes 150 kilometers per day. In case of excess an additional charge of €0,10 per extra km will apply.  For rentals lasting 3 to 28 days, price includes unlimited mileage.
For rentals lasting 28 days or more a 4000 km limit will apply.
Traffic Violations and Fines:
The renter is fully responsible for any traffic violations, tickets, or fines incurred during the rental period. This includes speeding tickets, parking fines, toll infractions, and any other fines for illegal or improper driving or parking. If you receive a ticket or fine while using the vehicle, you should pay it promptly. In the event that a traffic fine or penalty is issued to Carac during your rental period, we will notify you and forward your details to the relevant authorities providing a copy of the notice for your records. This allows for the official transfer of liability for the fine to you, as the designated driver during the rental period. Carac will fully cooperate with law enforcement and ensure the fine is redirected to the renter.
Deep Cleaning Fee :
If the vehicle is returned with an excessively dirty interior, a cleaning fee of €90 will be applied to cover the cost of professional deep cleaning. Examples include heavy stains, spilled liquids, lots of sand or mud inside, smoke odor, or pet hair that requires special cleaning. To avoid this charge, please treat the car respectfully and return it in a reasonably clean state.
Smoking:
Smoking in the rental vehicle is not permitted. Please refrain from smoking or vaping inside the car to avoid cleaning charges for smoke odor.
Pets:
Pets are allowed with prior approval. If a pet is transported, ensure the car is protected and cleaned of any hair or dirt to avoid cleaning fees.
Accident Administration Fee :
If you are involved in an accident or cause damage to the vehicle, a €40 administration fee will be charged. This fee covers the paperwork processing, insurance reports, and handling required by the rental company following an incident.
General Care:
You must take care of the car as a diligent owner would. This means not only driving safely, but also regularly checking the car’s condition during your rental. For longer rentals, please ensure the vehicle’s oil level, coolant, and tire pressure remain within normal ranges (our cars are maintained, but if a warning light appears, inform us). If you experience any mechanical issues or warning lights during your rental, notify Carac Rent a Car immediately for assistance. We provide 24/7 roadside support and can replace the vehicle within 24 hours if needed due to breakdown.
Proper Use:
Use the car only on regular, paved roads. Our vehicles are not allowed off-road or on unpaved trails, as this can cause damage not covered by insurance. Avoid driving through flooded areas or any terrain that could damage the car’s underside. The car is intended for personal transportation use only, commercial use, taxi service, or carrying passengers/goods for hire is forbidden. Towing any trailer or vehicle with the rental car is also not allowed. Our vehicles  are equipped with fleet systems that assist with maintenance schedules, roadside support, and general coordination for operational purposes only.
Compliance with Laws:
You must obey all Greek traffic laws. Do not drive under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any substance that could impair your driving ability – this is strictly prohibited and voids all insurance coverage. Always wear seat belts and use appropriate child seats for young children (per law, children under 12 or under 135cm should use a proper child restraint – we can provide child seats on request). Do not use the vehicle for any illegal purpose or dangerous activities (such as racing, rallying, or speed testing).
Pick-Up / Drop-Off
Pick-Up:
When you arrive to collect your car, you will need to present your driver’s license, ID/passport, and a valid credit or debit card in your name (for security verification and deposit). Before driving away, you will review and sign the rental agreement which outlines the condition of the vehicle and the fuel level. Our staff will give you instructions for the return process and answer any questions to ensure you’re comfortable with the vehicle.
Drop-Off:
You must return the vehicle on the agreed date, time, and location specified in your rental contract. If you wish to extend the rental period, you must notify Carac Rent a Car at least 48 hours in advance for approval (extensions are subject to vehicle availability). Late returns without prior approval have a grace period of one hour, After this one hour grace period additional charges will apply. If you return the car to a different location than the pick-up location, a one-way drop-off fee will apply (the amount varies from €40 to €150 based on distance). Upon return, the car’s condition will be inspected. The security deposit will be refunded after confirming there are no new damages, outstanding fees, or fuel discrepancies.
Pick-Up / Drop-Off Hours:
Our standard office hours are typically 09:00 to 21:00. We offer after-hours pick-up and drop-off for your convenience, but additional fees apply for this service:
- Pick-up or drop-off between 21:00 and 00:00 – €25 surcharge
- Pick-up or drop-off between 00:00 and 07:00 – €40 surcharge
- Pick-up or drop-off between 07:00 and 09:00 – €25 surcharge
These fees cover the cost of arranging staff to accommodate your schedule. After-hour services must be arranged in advance. In your booking confirmation email, we will provide detailed instructions for pick-up or return, especially if it’s outside normal hours or at a specific meeting point.
Vehicle Condition at Pick-Up:
The rental vehicle will be provided clean and in roadworthy condition, with at least 1/4 tank of fuel (often more). Any existing damage will be noted on the rental agreement. Please inspect the car along with our representative and ensure all pre-existing damages are recorded before you depart. We provide any required accessories (like child seats or GPS units) as confirmed in your booking, and their condition will also be noted.
Vehicle Return Condition: The car should be returned in essentially the same condition as it was rented (aside from normal wear and usage). This includes the fuel level and cleanliness of the vehicle’s interior. Please remove all personal belongings and trash. Excessively dirty interiors (stains, sand, food spills, etc.) may incur a cleaning charge (see Administrative and Cleaning Fees). We ask that you do not smoke in the rental vehicles – a cleaning fee will apply for evidence of smoking.
Cancellation & Refund Policy
Cancellations:
To cancel or modify a reservation, please contact us by email or phone with your booking details. Refunds (when applicable) will be processed to the original payment method. We strive to be fair and understanding, so if you have special circumstances, we encourage you to communicate with us.

We will refund any prepaid amount in full, or simply cancel the booking with no charge if you haven’t paid yet.
